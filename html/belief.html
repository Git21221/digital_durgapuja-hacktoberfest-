                    <p>Daksha, the king of the Himalayas and the plains, and his wife, Menka, had a daughter called Uma.
                        Uma, right from her childhood, started worshipping Lord Shiva as her would be husband. Shiva,
                        being pleased with the worship of Uma, came to marry her. Daksha did not like this tiger-skin
                        clad groom with ash & dirt spread over all of his body. Uma got married to Shiva but was
                        prevented by her father from moving to Kailash, the abode of Shiva. Daksha, later on, arranged
                        for a 'Yagya' where everyone except Shiva was invited. Uma, feeling ashamed of the behaviour of
                        her father and shocked by the attitude meted towards her husband, immolated herself. Shiva came
                        to know about this and went to Daksha's house. He lifted the charred body of Uma on his
                        shoulders and started dancing madly. Narayana came forward as a saviour and used his 'Chakra' to
                        cut the Body of Uma into pieces, whose various parts of the body fell at several spots all
                        through the Indian subcontinent and formed the sites of what are known as Shakti Peethas today.
                        Shiva was finally pacified when the last piece fell off from his shoulder. Narayana revived sati
                        as Uma for a new life. Ever since peace was restored, Uma, with her children, Ganesh and Kartik,
                        and with her two 'sakhis' - Jaya and Bijaya, comes to visit her parent's home each year during
                        the season of 'Sharat' or autumn when Durga Puja is celebrated. In Bengal, Durga is worshipped
                        as an affectionate yet powerful mother -she is the ideal protector that would give the people of
                        Bengal the strength to overcome every hurdle in their life.</p>
